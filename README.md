The project focused on using machine learning techniques to predict sales trends

In this project, data used was from a business that deals with the sales and supply of vehicles – cars, planes, ships, motorcycles, etc. Sales analytics for any business is essential because it affords the opportunity to further understand consumer behaviour in terms of buying patterns, trending products and to forecast future trends so as to enable the business position itself and be able to adequately meet the future needs of its customers. The dataset was sourced from the Kaggle website showing transaction details of vehicles bought and supplied to customers based in several countries (Carina Roldán, M. and Segura, G., 2014).

The data has 25 columns listing features such as product type, quantity ordered, unit price, sales, shipping mode, status of delivery, customer names, addresses and telephone numbers, order date, destination city and country, etc. It also has 2,823 samples and no less than 3 classes.

Artificial Intelligence(AI) using machine learning (ML) techniques was applied to the dataset to predict sales trend. Four techniques were used: Random Forest (RF) Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier, Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Clustering. Machine learning methods can be grouped into two: supervised or unsupervised. Typical of the supervised ML method, the data was divided into training and test data. The ML models were trained and then tested for predicting the target feature.
